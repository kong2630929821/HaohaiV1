It is easy to forget how far we have seen. Just a few days ago, we enjoyed our two-month anniversary on November 12, 2017. Since then, Bitcoin Gold (BTG) coins have been listed on the 46 markets with 26 exchanges and are supported by the top instant trading platforms (ShapeShift and Changelly) if we continue to expand our supported wallet network (including top hardware wallets and More and more mobile phones and desktop wallets will not be possible. Managed services that can carry out statutory transactions, such as Uphold. We thank them for their support, but we continue to work hard and make a big plan for this year.

At Bitcoin Gold, we are keenly aware that we need to make everyone aware of what we are doing and planning. To this end, we have been working to improve our communications, add discussion forums for our community, and launch Discord servers to improve real-time discussions. We have already made important updates to our core wallet software and can now be used on more platforms, and we have greatly expanded our global team so that we can make greater progress in various ways.

Today we will continue to focus on clarity and transparency and share the latest information on our roadmap - not just our roadmap for development, although this is critical, but it is also our plan for the project and the community.


# short term


We recently released our core wallet software update and will soon launch an Electrum Wallet tailored specifically for Bitcoin gold. We will also publish open source libraries built for BTG on BitCore, BitcoinJS, BitcoinJ, and CoPay so that developers already working with these libraries can more easily include Bitcoin in their projects. It's very important to use bitcoin gold to develop other people! (We also actively assist many third parties in integrating Bitcoin gold.)

The core agreement upgrade is on the road map. The Bech32 address is an improvement over the original base58 address used in Bitcoin; the new address overcomes some limitations, making the address more compatible with today's technologies (including SegWit and QR codes) and more user-friendly. We prioritize Bech32 because it is an important driver for future development, including the Lightning Network.
